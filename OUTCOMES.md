## 🚀 Key Differentiators vs Existing Solutions

### vs. Opossum (Current Market Leader)

| Aspect              | Opossum                   | Bulwark                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **TypeScript**      | Added via @types          | Native TypeScript-first                |
| **API Design**      | Event-driven, complex     | Promise-based, intuitive               |
| **Configuration**   | 20+ options, overwhelming | Smart defaults, progressive complexity |
| **Bundle Size**     | ~50KB                     | Target: <20KB                          |
| **Learning Curve**  | Steep                     | Gentle                                 |
| **Modern Features** | Limited                   | Adaptive thresholds, smart timeouts    |

**Opossum Pain Points We Solve:**

- ❌ Complex configuration with too many options
- ❌ Not TypeScript-native (types feel bolted-on)
- ❌ Event-driven API is harder to reason about
- ❌ No built-in adaptive behavior
- ❌ Limited observability out of the box

### vs. Other Libraries (Brakes, circuit-breaker-js, etc.)

| Library                | Status            | Our Advantage                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Brakes**             | Maintenance mode  | Active development, modern API |
| **circuit-breaker-js** | Archived          | Maintained, TypeScript-first   |
| **circuit-b**          | Socket-level only | HTTP-focused, more flexible    |
| **wontbreak**          | Axios-specific    | Framework-agnostic             |

## 🎨 Unique Value Propositions

### 1. **TypeScript-First Experience**

```typescript
// Zero configuration needed - smart defaults
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker();
const result = await breaker.execute(() => apiCall());

// Full type safety
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker<PaymentResponse>();
```

### 2. **API-Focused Design**

- **Smart Timeout Detection**: Automatically adapts to API response patterns
- **HTTP-Aware**: Built-in understanding of HTTP status codes and patterns
- **3rd Party Service Optimized**: Designed specifically for external API integration pain points

### 3. **Progressive Complexity**

```typescript
// Simple: Works out of the box
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker();

// Intermediate: Common configurations
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker({
  timeout: 5000,
  failureThreshold: 5,
});

// Advanced: Full control
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker({
  adaptiveTimeouts: true,
  bulkheadIsolation: true,
  customFailureDetection: (error) => error.code === "PAYMENT_DECLINED",
});
```

### 4. **Modern Observability**

- **Built-in Metrics**: Prometheus-ready metrics out of the box
- **Real-time Insights**: Live dashboard capabilities
- **Alerting Ready**: Structured events for monitoring systems

### 5. **Developer Experience Focus**

- **Excellent Documentation**: Interactive examples, common patterns
- **Framework Integrations**: First-class support for popular frameworks
- **Debugging Tools**: Clear error messages, state inspection utilities
