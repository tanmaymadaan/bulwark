- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Your Changes

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format your commits as:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(core): add adaptive timeout detection
fix(metrics): resolve memory leak in sliding window
docs(api): add circuit breaker configuration examples
test(integration): add comprehensive error handling tests
```

**Commit Types:**

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Clear title and description
- Reference any related issues
- Include screenshots/examples if applicable

## üèóÔ∏è Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Strict Mode**: Always use TypeScript strict mode
- **Explicit Types**: Provide explicit return types for public methods
- **No Any**: Avoid `any` type, use proper typing
- **JSDoc**: Document all public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Executes an operation with circuit breaker protection
 * @param operation - The async operation to execute
 * @returns Promise that resolves with operation result
 * @throws CircuitBreakerError when circuit is open
 */
public async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Code Style

- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Constants**: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- **File Names**: Use PascalCase for classes, camelCase for utilities

### Performance Requirements

- **<1ms Overhead**: Circuit breaker calls must have minimal performance impact
- **Memory Efficient**: Stable memory usage under load
- **Bundle Size**: Keep the library lightweight

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Test Coverage

- **95%+ Coverage**: All new code must have comprehensive tests
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe("CircuitBreaker", () => {
  describe("execute()", () => {
    it("should execute operation when circuit is closed", async () => {
      // Arrange
      const breaker = new CircuitBreaker({ failureThreshold: 5 });
      const mockOperation = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue("success");

      // Act
      const result = await breaker.execute(mockOperation);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe("success");
      expect(mockOperation).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(breaker.getState()).toBe(CircuitState.CLOSED);
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- CircuitBreaker.test.ts
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- **JSDoc**: Required for all public APIs
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in documentation
- **Error Conditions**: Document all possible errors

### README Updates

- Update examples if API changes
- Keep installation instructions current
- Document breaking changes
